                        as:</p>

                    <h2>7. Your consent to our use of your personal data</h2>

                            <p>There are six legal bases on which we may be entitled to collect and use your
                                personal data, which means that your express consent is not always
                                required.</p>

                            <p>For example, the law allows us to collect and use personal data to perform
                                contracts, or where this is necessary for our legitimate interests –
                                provided our use of the personal data is fair and balanced.</p>

                            <p>Where you provide us with your consent, you can withdraw this at any time by
                                contacting us on 01635 37844. Alternatively, you can email us at <a
